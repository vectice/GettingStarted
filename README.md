# Vectice Getting started
In this repository, you will find Vectice Quickstart and Tutorial projects, code and dataset samples to help you get started with Vectice. 

## Quickstart: what to expect 
The Quickstart notebook in this repo will guide you through using the Vectice API to

- Connect to Vectice
- Capture key artifacts inside iterations
- Auto-document notes and assets

To get the most out of the Quickstart, use the notebook alongside the Quickstart project documentation in docs.vectice.com and the Quickstart project available in your personal workspace in the Vectice app.

## Tutorial: What to expect
The tutorial notebook in this repo was used to log assets to the Tutorial project in Vectice. Browse this notebook to understand the assets that were captured in Vectice and that will be auto-documented in the App.
